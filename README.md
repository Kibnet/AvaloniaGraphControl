# AvaloniaGraphControl
A Graph display control for AvaloniaUI with model based on MSAGL

## Usage
Each individual graph is displayed through the GraphView control included in the assembly
```xml
<Window xmlns:agc="clr-namespace:AvaloniaGraphControl;assembly=AvaloniaGraphControl">
    <agc:GraphView Source="{Binding MyGraph}" Zoom="1.2" LayoutMethod="SugiyamaScheme" />
</Window>
```
The `Source` property is bound to a `Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Graph` instance from [MSAGL (Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout)](https://github.com/microsoft/automatic-graph-layout). Please have a look at this project for all information related to graph definition.

The following layout methods are available in MSAGL and can be set in the GraphView control independently of the graph model:
* [SugiyamaScheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_graph_drawing)
* [MDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_majorization)
* Ranking
* IncrementalLayout

The Graphview control and the MSAGL assemblies are bundled in [a nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AvaloniaGraphControl/).
The existing MSAGL nuget packages are dedicated to the .NET Framework and do not include any netstandard assembly. 

## Example of graph definition

```C#
public static Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Graph MyGraph
{
  get
  {
    var graph = new Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Graph("graph");
    graph.AddEdge("A", "B");
    graph.AddEdge("A", "D");
    graph.AddEdge("A", "E");
    graph.AddEdge("B", "C");
    graph.AddEdge("B", "D");
    graph.AddEdge("D", "A");
    graph.AddEdge("D", "E");
    graph.LayerConstraints.AddUpDownConstraint(graph.FindNode("A"), graph.FindNode("D"));
    foreach (var node in graph.Nodes)
    {
      node.Attr.Shape = Shape.Ellipse;
      node.LabelText = "   " + node.LabelText + "   ";
    }
    return graph;
  }
}
```
